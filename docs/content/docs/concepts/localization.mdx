Forui supports all 115 languages that Flutter natively does.

To enable localization for Forui widgets, add the `FLocalizations.delegate` in your call to the constructor for `CupertinoApp`, `MaterialApp`, or `WidgetsApp`. Afterwards, add the locales supported by your application.

<CodeSnippet snippet={defaultSnippet} />

The `FLocalizations` class also provides auto-generated `localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` lists. You can use
these instead of providing them manually if your application doesn't have any other localization messages.

<CodeSnippet snippet={localizationSnippet} />
