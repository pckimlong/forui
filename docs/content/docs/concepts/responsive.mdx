Forui contains responsive breakpoints based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).

## Predefined Breakpoints

All breakpoints are in logical pixels. Mobile devices are typically smaller than `sm` (640), while tablet and desktop
devices are typically larger than `md` (768) and `lg` (1024) respectively.

| Breakpoint | Minimum width | Accessor                     |
| :--------- | :------------ | :--------------------------- |
| `sm`       | 640           | `FThemeData.breakpoints.sm`  |
| `md`       | 768           | `FThemeData.breakpoints.md`  |
| `lg`       | 1024          | `FThemeData.breakpoints.lg`  |
| `xl`       | 1280          | `FThemeData.breakpoints.xl`  |
| `xl2`      | 1536          | `FThemeData.breakpoints.xl2` |

## Usage

<CodeSnippet snippet={usageSnippet} />

## Custom Breakpoints

Additional breakpoints can be added via an extension on `FBreakpoints`:

<CodeSnippet snippet={customBreakpointsSnippet} />

After which, the custom breakpoint can be accessed like so:

<CodeSnippet snippet={customBreakpointsUsageSnippet} />
